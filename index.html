    <p>todays education system is so changed a lot in todays educational system nothing intelligence is boosted  i am gonna talk about todays educational system ===== first tell me if youre a teenager then tell me what happens in school hmmmm lemme think mmmmmmm you go to school write the notes learn the notes and  and give tests exams etc . wanna bet for one thing the bet is that the thing that you have learned for exam try remembring it after 3 days 100% that you will forget that thing you will think that how can it be possible see in todays education system there is only test of memory power are you topper of youre class no,? then see the toppers feel them very proud why becuase they think that i am so intelligent imma so good at studies blah blah blah but but but dear toppers if youre readig this article then i only want to say that you re not intelligent you dont have intelligence power you have just a bit more memory power you read that ans or anything else got learned very fast cause you have a bit more intellgence than that backbenchers. most of the place did you listen that backbenchers in school is now a big buisness man did you know why its why cause the backbenchers are so chilled they are so relaxed about thier future they didnt think too much on other hand the toppers start thinking that oh i am so good what should i do what id o immma sooooooooooooooooooo intelligent but in fact you toppers think too much that youre brains gets disturbed and backbenchers get the chance. in this article i am not siding backbenchers i am just revealing the truth of todays educational system and i am not saying that toppers youre bad youre just feeling so much proud and backbenchers dont think that youre fool youre so intelligent every student in youre class is intelligent just dont compare anybody everyone is equal. <p>

        <p>does youre parents say that why re you playing games go study dont play mobile games if you want to play then go play outside etc. ofcourse you will listen these things because today everyone think bad about games you have listened that this man got mad cause of this game. this game stolde money from kid blah blah balh i dont why everyone wonder that games are bad for our mind . but if you play games in balacned amount then its so helpful like a vitamin. first we will talk about positive sides of games and there are negative sides tooo so first be positive so positive side: if you play games in a balacned amount its so helpful it increase your focusing power and youre reflexs how take an example youre in a PUBG match a enemy came AFAP( as fast as possible) you will create a wall that make youre reflexes better and imagine youre firing the opponent start giving you more damge AFAP you will click the shield button to create a shield and its also increases youre focusing power how take an example youre sitting in an FF match and duo attacked you ofc you will start killing the both duo so you will focus on both the enemies this increase youre focusing power now! as i told everything had positive side and negative side so now we will talk about its negative side:</p>
